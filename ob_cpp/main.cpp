     using namespace std;

     :

     If your program is being called within a script, it is useful for the script to know whether your program was successful. Thus, was born the convention of returning 0 for success from executable programs.
     
     C did not have native boolean types, so this was an integer. And this allowed us to return different numbers for different kinds of errors.
     In c++, once exception was introduced.its better practise to use exception.
